        <p>Of course, like every couple, we fight. There are moments of misunderstanding, moments of frustration💔. But at the end of the day, we always find our way back to each other. We realize our mistakes, we apologize, and we grow. Because love isn’t about being perfect🥺it’s about choosing each other, every single day❤🧚🏾‍♀

            And I choose you. Through every challenge, every joy, every moment we share, I promise to stay with you for the rest of my life.NDI MUFUNA NGA MBILU YANGA YOTHE MUTHUWANGA🥺🫂❤❤🧚🏾‍♀</p>
