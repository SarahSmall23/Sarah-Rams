        <h1>HOW IT STARTED</h1>
        <p>It all began with a simple hello that changed everything.</p>

        <p>It all started when you commented on your friend’s status ❤.Something about that moment caught your attention. Maybe it was fate, maybe it was curiosity, but whatever it was, it led you to ask for my number🤭

            From that single request, a conversation began. A conversation that turned into late-night chats, laughter over the smallest things, and the kind of connection that felt effortless. It didn’t take long for simple messages to turn into something deeper,something real🥹
            
            As days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, what started as a simple comment became a beautiful love story. You became my safe place, my happiness, my best friend. Through every challenge, every joy, and every moment in between, our love grew stronger🫂🫀🧚🏾‍♀
            
            Now, looking back, it’s funny to think that all it took was a birthday post and a little curiosity😂.Because from that small moment, I found the love of my life ane avha ene muthuwanga🥹❤</p>
